PWMAngband 1.4.0
================

This new version has a few significant changes ported from the Angband 4.2.0
version:

Monsters
- Ainur: most of these now align with one of the great Valar, and have
  corresponding powers
- Dragons: these have mostly been made stronger and deeper
- Snakes: some of these are now dangerous
- Spiders: more dangerous and deeper, with unique abilities

Game Mechanics
- Monster shapechanges
- Variable light and darkness are created by monsters, player gear and player
  spells, and the player has a meter to measure the light level on their
  square
- Monsters can whip or spit on the player from nearby
- Monster groups act more as a group, with leaders and sometimes bodyguards
- Innate spells (e.g. breaths) and cast spells (e.g. bolts) have separate
  frequencies
- Deeper in the dungeon shallow monsters are less likely to appear
- Monsters can teleport to the player
- Spiders can weave webs
- Monsters can have innate darkness around them
