# 'feat' lines describe the type of terrain. 'Level' is the maximum level of
# objects and monsters generated on such type of terrain (for monsters: during
# the day). 'Terrain type' is the feature used to represent the terrain (see
# terrain.txt). 'Symbol' is the symbol used on the metamap (see wild_info.txt).

# Important note: order must match entries in list-wild-feats.h.
